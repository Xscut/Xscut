### Hi there 

Hi, I'm Duancheng Zhao, a master student at South China University of Technology, who have published eight papers with respect to molecular property prediction and molecular design.

ðŸ’ž I'm looking to collaborate on AI for Science. If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact me via duanchengzhao@qq.com.
